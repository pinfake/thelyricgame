i'm a walk beast hard heeds
like a blunt mace coming down black lace?
chucking down blurred lines
down in the dirt nothing will change
hold it down, hold it down
keep standing on your knees
hold it down, hold it down
just keep standing on your knees

you want to go wild screaming until you're bleeding
ain't no class in the state that is all to beat
we made a bow ... blah?
to breath on?

oh please, its always when you talk so .... afforded to listen through?

we can't stand to be old fashioned
we can't dance when the rythmn can't hold us
beauty ain't for us
and beyond that fashion
the new beat ain't grand enough for us
their shackles can't hold us
and they're riding on no ride

we're gonna go out bleeding
oh, distorting whats savage? tank?
you're coming around blank still
your crystal ball is your crystal clear
hold it down, 
hold it down, 
should have been standing on my knees
... we'll be drowning in the sex pool
we can't stand to be old fashioned
we can't dance when the rythmn can't hold us
beauty ain't for us
and beyond that fashion
slacking down cause the breeding class hoard us
their shackles can't hold us
they're riding on no ride
they are all bound when the cave just can't hold us
