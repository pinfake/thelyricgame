i'm a walk beast hard heeds
like a blunt mace coming down black lace
tripping around blurred lines
down in the dirt nothing will change
hold it down, hold it down
keep standing on your knees
hold it down, hold it down
just keep standing on your knees

you want to go wild screaming until you're bleeding
ain't no class in the state that is all to beat
we made a bow ... ?????
to breath on?

oh please, its always when you talk so afforded to listen through?

we can't stand to be old fashioned
we can't dance when the rythmn can't hold us
beauty ain't for us
and beyond that passion
the new beat ain't grand enough for us
their shackles can't hold us
and they're riding on no ride

we're gonna go out bleeding
oh, distorting whats ?????
you're coming around blank still
your crystal ball is your crystal clear
hold it down, 
hold it down, 
should have been standing on my knees
if ??? ?? ?????? ?? rocks will be drowning in the sex pool
we can't stand to be old fashioned
we can't dance when the rythmn can't hold us
beauty ain't for us
and beyond that passion
slacking down cause the breeding class hoard us
their shackles can't hold us
they're riding on no ride
they are all bound when the cave just can't hold us

i keep holding it down still,
we don't care for fence your pressing
we keep holding it down still,
i keep holding it down still,
oh

We can't stand to be old fashioned
We can't dance when the rythmn can't hold us
beauty ain't for us
and beyond that passion
the new beat ain't grand enough for us
their shackles can't hold us

because all so fashion
They like old moves to dance for us  

and they're riding on no ride
they're all bold while the cane
