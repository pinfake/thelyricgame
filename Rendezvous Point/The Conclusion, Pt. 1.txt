confusion reigns inside this trap of mind again
conflicting voices
kindness is lost 
there is no place for love or tears
madness starts here

there is darkness inside these eyes
fill with hate and with this vice
distorted new old life
there is emptyness inside this war
i'd/ll? never meet the storm
from where it all begin

you will never know my true story 
or why this is my salvation
no one will ever understand
there's no logic here
there is just hunger
the math ....... justify my .....
selfishness and .......death?
the animal has got to me
mercy is gone
My hate and my fist growing
my ... and craving for more is gone
nothing that can stop me now
i want it all and you have to burn????

Make a wish say a prayer if it 
crawl with your knees and scream
This is no time to surrender it is my time to shine

If I rule my mind
